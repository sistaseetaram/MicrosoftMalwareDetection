# Microsoft Malware detection:
## Business/Real-world Problem
### What is Malware?
The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices or to people.

### Problem Statement
In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

### Real-world/Business objectives and constraints.
Minimize multi-class error.
Multi-class probability estimates.
Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute.

### Data Overview
Source : [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data)<br/>
For every malware, we have two files<br/>
.asm file [read more](https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/asm) <br/>
.bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header)
Total train dataset consist of *200GB* data out of which *50Gb of data is .bytes files* and *150GB of data is .asm files*:
Lots of Data for a single-box/computer.
There are total *10,868 .bytes files* and *10,868 asm files* total 21,736 files
There are *9 types of malwares (9 classes)* in our give data
**Types of Malware:**
1. Ramnit
2. Lollipop
3. Kelihos_ver3
4. Vundo
5. Simda
6. Tracur
7. Kelihos_ver1
8. Obfuscator.ACY
9. Gatak

## Mapping the real-world problem to an ML problem
### Type of Machine Learning Problem
There are nine different classes of malware that we need to classify a given a data point => Multi class classification problem

### Performance Metric
Source: [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification#evaluation)

### Metric(s): Test Score achieved(0.00736)
- Multi class log-loss
- Confusion matrix

## Machine Learing Objectives achieved:
**Objective:** Predict the probability of each data-point belonging to each of the nine classes.

## Constraints that are achieved in this project:
- Class probabilities are needed.
- Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss.
- Some Latency constraints.

## File Strucure:
### MMD1:
- Read Data
- Exploratoray Data Analysis
- Feature Extraction
### MMD2:
- Feature Selection
- Validating selected features
- Final Data set preperation
### MMD3:
- Train Test Split
- Modelling And HyperParam Tuning
- Compute performance on test data

## Machine:
### Run time -
- Intel 12 Cores (6 CPU)
- 16GB RAM
- 256GB SSD
- 1TB HDD

## NOTE: Detailed explanation of my approach is given with the code.
